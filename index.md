## My name is Maja Cannavo, and I'm a senior geography major and computer science minor at Middlebury College.
I'm working on projects that bridge my interests in GIS and programming. Check out the links below for details, or check out my GitHub profile [here](https://github.com/majacannavo)!

[Developing a Minimal GIS Plugin for Teaching Introductory QGIS](https://majacannavo.github.io/jterm21/jterm21main): During Winter Term ("J-Term") 2021, I worked with Prof. Joseph Holler to build MiMiGIS ("Middlebury Minimal GIS"), a QGIS plugin containing a couple of easy-to-use algorithms and a set of SVG icons designed for the Middlebury Geography Department's introductory GIS course.

[GEOG 323 -- Open Source Geographic Information Science](https://majacannavo.github.io/geog323/geog323main): Take a look at what I've been working on this spring as I gain experience across the realm of open source geographic information science.
