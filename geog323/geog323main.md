# GEOG 323 -- Open Source Geographic Information Science

This spring, I'm taking [Open Source Geographic Information Science](https://gis4dev.github.io/) with Prof. Joseph Holler. In this course we're exploring the world of geographic information science using open source software, reading and analyzing critical GIS research, and gaining experience with a variety of spatial data types and analyses. Check out the posts below to see what I've been working on!
